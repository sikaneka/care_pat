# 🏥 Smart Healthcare Monitoring System for Bedridden Patients

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to create an innovative and intelligent environment tailored to the needs of patients with limited mobility. By leveraging advanced technologies such as **IoT (Internet of Things)**, **machine learning**, **sensor networks**, and **human-computer interaction**, the system is designed to enhance the quality of life for immobile individuals by providing **customized settings with comfort and convenience**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Provide continuous **health monitoring** for bedridden patients.
- Enable **real-time alerts** for falls or abnormal conditions.
- **Alleviate boredom** through emotion-based music recommendations.
- Improve the quality of care with **remote monitoring and automation**.

## 🔍 Features

- **Fall Detection**  
  IoT devices monitor the patient’s room for falls or unexpected movements. In case of a fall, the system immediately alerts caregivers or medical personnel.

- **Remote Health Monitoring**  
  Vital signs such as **heart rate**, **temperature**, and other health metrics are continuously tracked. Healthcare providers receive alerts in case of abnormal readings.

- **Emotion-Based Music Playback**  
  Songs are automatically played to patients based on their detected emotional state, aiming to reduce boredom and improve mental well-being.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **IoT Devices** (Sensors for motion, temperature, heart rate, etc.)
- **Machine Learning Models** (Emotion detection, anomaly detection)
- **Remote Monitoring Systems**
- **Human-Computer Interaction Tools**

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Integrate with **Electronic Health Records (EHR)** systems.
- Add **voice interaction** features for hands-free control.
- Enhance emotion detection using **facial recognition and NLP**.
